*In Hours*

During the fall semester, each team member spent around 50 hours on this project. We spent at least one hour a week for a face-to-face meeting. Loc Tran took responsibility for designing the application user interface and implementing six Sorting algorithms. Designing application UI took 10 hours and implementing each sorting algorithm took around 7 hours. Zach Carey took responsibility for implementing Searching algorithms and other data structures. Zach spent around 40 hours on implementing two searching algorthims and three data structures, and an additional 10 hours on doing paper work for this project. After fall semester, we had the application working and demonstrated the animation of some algorithms. However, there were over 75 warnings and there were still some bugs that caused the application crash sometimes.

For the Spring semester, each team member spent about 65 to 70 hours on this project. We spent most of the time on refactoring and debugging. Each algorthim required us to spend additional hours to get it running without any warnings and bugs. We spent 20 to 25 hours of time on the Expo poster, presentations, docs, and the final report.
