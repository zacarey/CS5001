## Self Assessment - Carey
##### Introduction
Our project is an iOS application that teaches Computer Science concepts with a focus on data structures 
and algorithmic processes. We wish to communicate basic to complex processes through the use of 
graphics, animations, text, and user input. The goal is to increase the student's comprehenison and ability 
in the domain of Computer Science, specifically with algorithms.
##### Past Experience
As a senior in CS we have the necessary knowledge of foundational algorithms and beyond. Classes like Data 
Structures and Design & Analysis of Algorithms will be excellent references in our project. In our current trajectory,
we will implement algorithms for search and graphs. Algorithms such as bubble sort to more complex processes like
merge sort have repeteadly shown up in course work. That is why we hope to convey them easily and accurately 
for an in depth learning environment and future referencing.

My co-op experience isn't strictly related to this project. I do .Net developing at my current co-op for large scale
web applications. This project will be strictly swift with some javascript peppered in. I have minimal swift 
experience, but I am excited to learn more about iOS development.
##### Motivation and Project Approach
What excites me most about this project is that this could really help some people understand the
complex concepts of Computer Science. I'm hoping that we can tackle these topics in such a way that
students can learn a topic visually, textually, and/or by application. 

Currently we're appraching this project topically. Loc will be handling sorting algorithms 
while I do searching. We plan on diving into graphs as well once we're stable with the basics. Hopefully, this
can be used as a teaching tool for Computer Science professors.
