## Project Sought

- I am planning to build a native iOS application using Swift. This application will demonstrate the animation of Computer Scienece Algorithms (These algorthims were taught in Data Structure and Design and Analysis of Algorithms courses). This application will help users to visuallize and understand these Algorithm by showing the animated step-by-step explanation and PDF documents. Users also can input their data and see the visuallization.  Algorithms and data structures will be included:
  - Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Heap Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort and Selection Sort.
  - Searching Algorithms: Linear Search, Binary Search, Breadth-first Search and Depth-first Search.  
  - Data Structures: Linked-List, Queue and Stack.
  - Other algorithms: N-Queen Problem and Tower of Hanoi.
