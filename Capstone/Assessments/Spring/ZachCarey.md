## Spring Self-Assessments

I completed images, documentation, and search algorithms. Loc built the framework of what our app is now while I helped add these functions, features, and designs. Outside of my coursework and work experience, I do iOS development for QuestX- which in turn I was able to apply my iOS development experience from that to this project.

Some of the things that I learned from this project were managing my time better, Photoshop experience, and a new (to me) type of iOS architecture. My previous iOS experience is with the App Coordinator method compared to CSPrep which is more focused around a Model-View-Controller architecture. In addition to this I learned more about managing older versions of iOS.

Loc and I completed an iOS application that teaches basic CS algorithms to users. The algorithms we implemented are commonly taught in CS1, CS2, and Data Structures. As well as these algorithms we included visualizations and descriptions for commonly used data structures. We wanted to add more advanced concepts to this list, but due to time constrains and project complexities we were unable to. 

Loc did a fantastic job of laying the foundation for CSPrep. I helped by applying my previous knowledge where I could as well as cleaning up design issues when they popped up. I canâ€™t think of any communication issues but the only room for improvement would be improving git skills and working with source control.
