## Zach Carey Self-Assessments (Final)

I completed images, documentation, and search algorithms. Loc built the framework of what our app is now while I helped add these functions, features, and designs. Outside of my coursework and work experience, I do iOS development for QuestX- which in turn I was able to apply my iOS development experience from that to this project.

Some of the things that I learned from this project were managing my time better, Photoshop experience, and a new (to me) type of iOS architecture. My previous iOS experience is with the App Coordinator method compared to CSPrep which is more focused around a Model-View-Controller architecture. In addition to this I learned more about managing older versions of iOS.
