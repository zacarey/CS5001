# Loc Tran Self-Assessment (Final)

For CSPrep, I implemented the sorting algorithms and the Tower of Hanoi visualization. I have 
experience with Swift development during my co-op. During this project I have learned a lot more 
about Swift and iOS development in general. As well as development, I also designed the User 
Interface for this application. I learned how to use Sketch, a wire framing application, to 
create the layout for CSPrep. I used TableView for the main screen and CocoaPod to import 
KDPulseButton- a library for creating effects for button presses. Finally, I prepared the reading
documents for the Sorting algorithms. 

After two semesters, I have successfully implemented animations for the sorting algorithms. I 
also created a view controller that takes the input from users. However, this view controller 
only worked for sorting algorithms, and I have failed to make it work for other algorithms and 
data structures.
