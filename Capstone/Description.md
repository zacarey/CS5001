## Description

### CSPrep

###### Background

Computer Science (CS) is one of the fastest growing fields in the United States. It can be applied in almost every field of study and is a desired compliment to several degrees. While it may be an easy choice for postsecondary education, learning the foundational concepts is not as easy. 

###### Problem Statement

CS can be daunting to the novice. Learning complex processes and abstract thinking is a step that all must take when tackling this subject. This is usually learned through pseudocode and application while sometimes the student may be able to apply, but not necessarily understand what is happening behind the scenes and why it is important.

###### Primary Goal

Develop an iOS application that describes introductory to intermediate algorithmic processes and data structures simply and intuitively to the user.

###### Helpful Skills
- Swift
- Interactive Javascript
- Xcode
- Web Development experience
